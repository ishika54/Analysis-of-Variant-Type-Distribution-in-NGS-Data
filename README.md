# Analysis-of-Variant-Type-Distribution-in-NGS-Data
 In this analysis, we aimed to investigate the distribution of variant types in our NGS dataset, which was obtained from SRA. Understanding the composition of variants, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (INDELs), is crucial for characterizing genetic diversity in the dataset.
